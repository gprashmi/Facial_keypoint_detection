# Facial_keypoint_detection

To identify the vital areas in the face through keypoint detection to understand the emotion & expression of a person. 

Facial keypoints (also called facial landmarks) are the small magenta dots shown on each of the faces in the image above. In each training and test image, 
there is a single face and 68 keypoints, with coordinates (x, y), for that face. These keypoints mark important areas of the face: the eyes, corners of the mouth, the nose, etc.
